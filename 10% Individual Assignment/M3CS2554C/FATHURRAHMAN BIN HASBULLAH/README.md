# 🚀 A Spike Test and Analysis of Drupal-Based Hosting Using JMeter

<div style="text-align: justify;">
There are currently many web hosting services on the internet. As of this day web hosts, such as Bluehost, Hostinger, IONOS, etc., all share one common service, which is to provide a place on a server and allocate all the web application's files, creating an accessible storage for internet users. Although they provide the same service, the performance and vulnerability of the service play an important role for consumers to choose their preferred web host. Hence, the objective of this article is to design, execute, and analyse a performance test plan for a web application using a specialised testing tool.

## 🔧 About JMeter

<div style="text-align: justify;">
The tool that was used for this experiment is JMeter. It is an open-source testing tool from Apache that provides a wide range of performance testing capabilities. The application is Java-based and allows testing of client-server applications such as databases, FTP servers, websites, web services, etc. <b>The main interest for this study is to use JMeter and run a spike test on a local web application (demo).</b> The tool was chosen for the benefits of:
</div>

### 🌐 Server Compatibility

<div style="text-align: justify;">
JMeter is a thoroughly capable tool that can address load and performance testing for different products, ignoring the server or protocol. JMeter disregards protocols such as HTTP or HTTPS web services, databases, FTP, LDAP, MOM (message-orientated middleware) through NoSQL (MongoDB), and JMS.

### 📋 Methodology

<div style="text-align: justify;">
The test was conducted on a single laptop workstation connected to a Wi-Fi (802.11x) with a 5 GHz band network. The scenario can be described as a single server testing. The single laptop workstation locally hosts the website's web server and, at the same time, acts as threads to the website itself. The results of the test cannot be taken as literal, since the environment or setup of the test does not fully utilise the <b>real-world</b> simulation of web application testing. However, after a few literature reviews, the best setup for the testing was considered; hence, it was implemented in the current setup. The steps taken for the test were:

##  📝 JMeter Spike Test Analysis and Interpretation

 ### 1️⃣ Over Time Analysis

#### Active Threads Pattern
- **Peak Load**: ~127 active threads at 01:22:47
- **Test Duration**: Approximately 2 minutes (01:22:46 to 01:22:48)
- **Load Pattern**: Three distinct spikes with smooth transitions
  - **Spike 1** (0-30s): 100 threads ramping up gradually
  - **Spike 2** (30-55s): 200 threads creating maximum load
  - **Spike 3** (55-80s): 100 threads for final spike
- **Observation**: The thread pattern successfully executed the planned spike test configuration, with clear load phases visible in the graph

#### Network Throughput (Bytes/sec)
- **Starting Point**: ~240,000 bytes/sec
- **Peak Throughput**: ~490,000 bytes/sec (approximately double the initial rate)
- **Pattern**: Directly correlates with active thread count, peaking during second spike
- **Interpretation**: Network bandwidth scales proportionally with load, indicating no network-level bottleneck. The system was able to transfer data efficiently even at peak load of 200 concurrent threads.

#### Response Latencies Over Time
- **Baseline Latency**: ~9,000ms (9 seconds) at low load (first spike)
- **Peak Latency**: ~13,500ms (13.5 seconds) at maximum load (second spike)
- **Increase**: 50% degradation from baseline to peak
- **Recovery**: Latency decreases to ~9,000ms during third spike (100 threads)
- **Secondary Metric** (orange line): Remains consistently flat at ~500ms throughout all spikes
- **Critical Finding**: Even at baseline with minimal load (100 threads), response times of 9 seconds indicate serious performance issues. The 13.5-second peak response time during the 200-thread spike is unacceptable for any web application. The orange line likely represents static assets or cached responses, which maintain acceptable performance.

---

### 2️⃣ Throughput Analysis

#### Responses Per Second
- **Starting Rate**: ~9 responses/sec (first spike)
- **Peak Rate**: ~18 responses/sec (second spike - 200 threads)
- **Post-Peak Decline**: Drops sharply as load decreases in third spike
- **Interpretation**: The system achieved maximum throughput at peak load but could not sustain higher rates, suggesting capacity limits were reached. Doubling the thread count (100→200) only doubled throughput, indicating linear scaling up to the limit.

#### Hits Per Second
- **Starting Rate**: ~10.5 hits/sec
- **Ending Rate**: ~17.5 hits/sec
- **Pattern**: Continuous linear increase throughout the test duration
- **Anomaly**: Unlike other metrics, hits/sec continues to rise even during ramp-down phase (third spike)
- **Possible Causes**: 
  - Cached responses being served more efficiently as test progresses
  - Background requests or retries accumulating from previous spikes
  - HTTP Cache Manager becoming more effective over time
  - Measurement artifact from overlapping thread groups

#### Transactions Per Second
- **Multiple Transaction Types**: Chart shows 4 different transaction types (corresponding to 4 HTTP requests)
- **Dominant Transaction** (red line): Peaks at ~8.5 transactions/sec
  - Likely represents one of the recipe pages (most frequently accessed)
- **Other Transactions** (blue, green, orange lines): Remain relatively flat at ~2-3 transactions/sec
  - Represent other recipe pages and search functionality
- **Interpretation**: Load distribution is uneven across endpoints. One specific page/endpoint dominates traffic while others show minimal activity. This could indicate:
  - Weighted request distribution in test design
  - One endpoint being significantly slower, creating a bottleneck
  - Realistic user behavior simulation where main landing pages get more traffic

### 3️⃣ Response Times Analysis

#### Response Time vs Active Threads
- **Low Load (0-40 threads)**: 6,000-10,000ms with high variability
- **Medium Load (40-100 threads)**: 8,000-12,000ms, increasing gradually
- **High Load (100-127 threads)**: 20,000-27,000ms, dramatic spike at peak
- **Peak Response Time**: ~27,000ms (27 seconds) at ~120 active threads
- **Volatility**: Extreme fluctuations at peak load (ranging from 13,000ms to 27,000ms)
- **Recovery Pattern**: As threads decrease post-peak, response times drop to 8,000-15,000ms range

#### Multiple Request Types Performance
- **Primary Request** (blue line - dominant): Shows severe degradation
  - Starts at 6-8 seconds
  - Peaks at 27 seconds under load
  - Likely represents dynamic recipe page rendering
- **Secondary Requests** (other colored lines): Remain under 2,000ms (2 seconds) throughout
  - Probably static assets, CSS, JavaScript, images
  - Well-handled by HTTP Cache Manager
- **Interpretation**: The main page/endpoint (blue) is the clear performance bottleneck, while static resources or simpler endpoints maintain reasonable response times. This suggests:
  - Database queries for recipe content are slow
  - Drupal's page rendering for recipe nodes is inefficient
  - No effective page-level caching implemented

 ---

### 🚨 Key Performance Issues/ Bottlenecks Identified

#### 1. **Unacceptable Baseline Performance** ⚠️
Even with minimal load (~90-100 threads during first spike), the application shows 9-second response times. This indicates fundamental performance problems:
- **Database query optimization needed**: Recipe content queries are likely unoptimized
- **Inefficient server-side processing**: Drupal page rendering taking too long
- **Lack of page caching**: No evidence of page-level caching (Drupal's cache system may be disabled)
- **Potential resource contention**: Single laptop workstation hosting both web server and acting as load generator

#### 2. **Poor Scalability** 📉
The application does not scale linearly with increased load:
- **2x thread increase** (100 → 200 threads) resulted in **3x response time increase** (9s → 27s)
- This super-linear degradation indicates resource exhaustion:
  - CPU saturation (likely on single-core processing)
  - Memory pressure (possible memory leaks or inefficient memory usage)
  - Database connection pool exhaustion (MySQL connection limits reached)
  - Apache/PHP-FPM worker process limits
- The second spike (200 threads) pushed the system beyond its capacity

#### 3. **Severe Performance Bottleneck in Recipe Pages** 🔴
The primary endpoint (recipe pages) is the clear bottleneck:
- While secondary requests (static assets) maintain <2 second response times
- The main recipe page endpoint degrades to 27 seconds under load
- Suggests specific issues:
  - Complex database queries to fetch recipe data, ingredients, related content
  - Drupal Views or custom queries without proper indexing
  - N+1 query problems (multiple queries per page load)
  - Lack of query result caching

#### 4. **High Response Time Variability** 📊
The wide fluctuations (13s-27s at peak load) indicate:
- **Inconsistent resource availability**: CPU time slicing between web server and test threads
- **Possible garbage collection pauses**: PHP or MySQL memory management
- **Database connection pool exhaustion**: Threads waiting for available database connections
- **Competing processes**: Test environment running both server and JMeter on same machine
- **Lock contention**: Database table locks during concurrent write operations (if any)

#### 5. **Search Functionality Performance** 🔍
While not the primary bottleneck, the search endpoint (`/search/node?keys=pasta`) shows:
- Similar degradation pattern to recipe pages
- Drupal's search module is known to be resource-intensive
- Full-text search without optimization (consider Apache Solr or Elasticsearch integration)

##  ⚖ Recommendation and Conclusion

### 🔴 Immediate Actions (Critical Priority)

1. **Enable Drupal Page Caching**
   - Enable Drupal's internal page cache for anonymous users
   - Configure cache lifetime appropriately (e.g., 15 minutes)
   - Expected improvement: 70-80% reduction in response times for repeated requests

2. **Profile the Recipe Pages**
   - Use Drupal Devel module with XHProf or Blackfire.io
   - Identify which specific code/queries are slowest
   - Focus on the blue line endpoint (likely `/recipes/*` pages)

3. **Database Query Optimization**
   - Enable MySQL slow query log
   - Identify queries taking >1 second
   - Add appropriate database indexes for:
     - Recipe content type fields
     - Taxonomy terms (likely used for recipe categories)
     - Node relationships (related recipes)

### 🟡 Short-term Improvements (High Priority)
 
1. **Implement Opcode Caching**
     - Enable OPcache in PHP configuration
     - Configure appropriate memory size (128MB+)
     - Expected improvement: 30-40% reduction in CPU usage

2. **Optimize Drupal Views (if used)**
     - Review recipe listing/display Views configurations
     - Reduce number of fields loaded
     - Implement Views query caching
     - Consider using View's AJAX pagination instead of full page loads

3. **Database Connection Pooling**
     - Review MySQL max_connections setting (increase if needed)
     - Configure PHP-FPM worker pool appropriately
     - Set up persistent database connections

### 🟢 Long-term Strategy (Medium Priority)
 
1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Implement load balancing across multiple web server nodes
   - Use HAProxy or Nginx as load balancer
   - Share session storage via Redis/Memcached

2. **Separate Database Server**
   - Move MySQL to dedicated hardware/VM
   - Reduce resource contention
   - Allow independent scaling of web and database tiers

### 🤔 Test Environment Considerations

Since this test was conducted on a **single laptop workstation** (192.168.1.24):

**Limitations of Current Setup**:
- Web server and JMeter client competing for same CPU/RAM resources
- Results may not reflect production performance accurately
- Local environment resource constraints likely exaggerate issues
- No separation of concerns (database, web server, load generator all on same machine)

---

### 🎯 Conclusion
<div style="text-align: justify;">
The spike test reveals that the Drupal-based hosting environment faces <b>critical performance challenges</b> that must be addressed before production deployment. With baseline response times of 9 seconds escalating to 27 seconds under moderate load (200 concurrent users), the application is **not production-ready** for any significant user traffic.
