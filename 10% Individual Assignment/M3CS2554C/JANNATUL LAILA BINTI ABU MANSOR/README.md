## 1. INTRODUCTION

<p align="justify"> Web application performance is a crucial factor in determining user satisfaction and business success in today's digital environment.  This report uses stress testing techniques to provide a thorough performance analysis of the Joomla Launch website (https://launch.joomla.org/).  Stress testing helps find breaking points and performance degradation before they affect actual users by assessing how a system responds to extreme load conditions.  In order to evaluate the application's responsiveness, stability, and resource management under pressure, this study uses GTMetrix to simulate high user traffic. </p>

## 2. OBJECTIVES

<p align="justify"> This stress testing assignment's main goals are: 
<ul>
 <li> To use GTMetrix to perform stress testing on https://launch.joomla.org/. </li>
 <li> To assess key performance indicators (KPIs) like Core Web Vitals, error rate, throughput, and response time. </li>
 <li> To locate failure points and performance bottlenecks under heavy load. </li>
 <li> To offer data-based suggestions for web application optimization. </li>
</ul>
</p>

 ## 3. WHAT IS STRESS TESTING
 
<p align="justify"> One kind of performance testing called stress testing assesses a system's ability to function in harsh circumstances which beyond its typical operating range. Determining the system's resilience, stability, and error-handling skills in the face of extreme traffic spikes, resource depletion, or peak loads is the aim.  In contrast to load testing, which replicates anticipated user loads, stress testing tests the system's limits in order to identify potential failures and breaking points. </p>

## 4. TOOL SELECTION JUSTIFICATION

<p align="justify"> The tool selected for this analysis is GTMetrix. </p>
<p align="justify"> 
<ol>
    <li> Easy to Use: web-based and accessible; no installation needed. </li>
    <li> Comprehensive Reporting: Offers waterfall charts, Core Web Vitals, and comprehensive performance metrics. </li>
    <li> Real-Browser Testing: This method mimics real-user circumstances by using real Chrome browsers. </li>
    <li> Global Test Servers: Enables testing from various geographical locations, such as Seattle, Washington. </li>
    <li> Free Tier Availability: Ideal for personal and academic use. </li>
  </ol> 
 While not a traditional stress testing tool like JMeter, GTMetrix can simulate repeated loads and analyze performance degradation, making it a practical choice for this study. </p>

 ## 5. TEST ENVIRONMENT SETUP
 
<p align="justify"> The test environment was set up to create a baseline before carefully introducing stressors.
 <ol>
    <li> Testing Tool: GTMetrix (Web-based) </li>
    <li> Test Server Location: Seattle, WA, USA </li>
    <li> Browser: Chrome 125.0.0.0 </li>
    <li> Lighthouse Version: 12.3.0 </li>
    <li> Target Application URL: https://launch.joomla.org/ </li>
    <li> Network Throttling: Simulated (Default GTMetrix settings) </li>
    <li> Type of Test: Stress testing using performance trend tracking and repeated analysis </li>
  </ol>
   </p>
