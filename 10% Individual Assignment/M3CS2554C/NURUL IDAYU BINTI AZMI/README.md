## 1. Capacity Testing

### 💡 What is Capacity Testing?

Capacity testing is a type of performance testing used to find out the maximum number of users or requests a website, system, or application can handle before it slows down or starts failing.

In other words, it helps one to answer:

“How many users can use this system at the same time before performance drops?”

The goal is to identify the system’s limit (capacity threshold), the point where response times become too slow or errors start to appear.

---

## 2. Objective

- This report focuses on capacity testing of a web application using Grafana k6. Capacity testing aims to determine the maximum number of concurrent users or requests a system can handle before performance degrades or failures occur. 

- The objective of this test is to perform capacity testing on the target web API to identify the system’s upper performance limit. Specifically, the test measures how response time, throughput, and error rate change as the number of virtual users (VUs) increases.

### Table 1: Test Setup Details

| Type | Context |
|----------------|--------------------|
| Testing type | Capacity Testing | 
| Tool name | k6 (command-line load testing tool |
| Target | https://fakerestapi.azurewebsites.net/ |
| Test duration | 10 seconds per scenario |
| Virtual users | 100, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000,(for comparison) | 

<br><br>
<img width="584" height="267" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/366b5d54-8f4a-44cf-b171-a9c52f7bbba7" />
<br><br>
The test was conducted using k6, written in JavaScript (.js) format.
The following code defines the test scenario, including the target website URL and virtual user configuration

<br><br>

<img width="834" height="287" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a3889ee-d81f-4e42-8823-58ed496c6ccd" />
In this experiment, five separated scripts were written in JavaScript (.js) format where each script simulated 10, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 concurrent virtual users respectively, with each test running for 10 seconds. Above is one of the example coding that include 100 virtual users in 10 seconds.

<br><br>
The k6 testing was performed using the command:
<img width="512" height="30" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7789cf47-43d2-4799-9485-8bf34f8674f5" />

<br><br>
This command runs the k6 test script named test100.js, simulating the defined virtual users (VUs) and test duration. The --out csv=results/output100.csv option exports the test results in CSV format and saves them in the results folder for further analysis.

<br><br>
- The following shows the execution of the test100.js script and its corresponding result:

## 7. Graphs and Data Analysis

### Average Response Time
<img width="650" height="377" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ffefc9e-bea2-4f54-8cb7-7fa60534326d" />

The average response time represents how long the server takes to respond to user requests under different levels of load. In this capacity testing, the average latency increased significantly as the number of virtual users (VUs) rose from 100 to 1000, with the mean response time jumping from 989 ms to 10,574 ms. This sharp increase indicates that the system began experiencing  queuing delays as the number of concurrent requests grew, suggesting that the server’s available processing capacity or bandwidth was being stretched.

Interestingly, when the number of users increased further to 2000, 3000, and 4000 VUs, the average response time dropped again, ranging between 3504 ms to 5731 ms. This behavior appears counterintuitive, as one would normally expect response times to keep rising under heavier load.

Overall, the response time results show that the system started to slow down when more users were added. After a certain point, the performance seemed to stabilize, possibly because the system adjusted to the heavy load. However, this improvement did not mean the system was fully stable, as shown in the Error Rate section, some requests still failed or timed out. This means the recovery was only partial and temporary.

### Error Percentage
<img width="622" height="375" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fc733b3-65cb-415d-bbb8-ddc8014b100b" />

The error percentage metric indicates the proportion of failed requests compared to the total number of requests made during the test. This is a critical measure for identifying when a system begins to fail or become unreliable under increasing load.

In the results, no errors were observed at 100 virtual users (VUs), which confirms that the Fake REST API can handle low levels of traffic efficiently and respond successfully to all incoming requests. However, at 1000 VUs, errors began appearing (0.2%), indicating the system was nearing its limit.

When the load increased to 2000 and 3000 VUs, the error rate jumped to 32.49% and 43.58%, showing that the server could not process all requests successfully. This suggests the Fake REST API started to become overloaded or reached its resource capacity, resulting in request timeouts or dropped connections.

At 4000 VUs, the error percentage slightly dropped to 37.97%, possibly because the system rejected requests faster instead of letting them time out. Overall, this shows that the maximum stable capacity for the API is around 1000 VUs, as performance degrades rapidly beyond that point.

### Interpretation
 - The Fake REST API can handle up to around 1000 virtual users before response times become unstable and error rates increase notably.

- The irregular drop in average latency at higher loads likely reflects cloud load balancing or temporary throttling, not genuine stability.

- From a capacity standpoint, the practical load limit of the API is estimated at between 1000–2000 concurrent users, depending on request complexity.

## 8. Conclusion

Based on the capacity testing conducted using Grafana k6 on the Fake REST API, the results show a clear relationship between the number of virtual users, average response time, and error percentage.

As the number of users increased, the average response time rose significantly, indicating that the server required more time to handle concurrent requests. Meanwhile, the error percentage also increased after 1000 virtual users, showing that the system started failing to respond to some requests once it reached its limit.

From these results, it can be concluded that the maximum reliable capacity of the API is around 1000 concurrent users. Beyond this point, the system experiences higher latency and error rates, which reduces overall stability. Therefore, optimization such as load balancing, caching, or server scaling would be needed to improve its performance under heavy traffic.
